# AMAH :Â Automatic Markov-chain Actuated Hexapod
A hexapod robot that learns to walk by trial and errors, using Markov chain.

Please remark that I didn't design or build the robot itself (that was done by [Vincent Studer](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/vincent-studer-8179a864)).
My job was to program the leg control and the learning.
